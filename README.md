vcat
====

This repository contains the Java code for the vCat 'visual' category renderer,
which uses Graphviz (http://graphviz.org/) to render the category structure of
MediaWiki wikis (in particular those run by the Wikimedia Foundation) as
graphical trees.

It replaces a similar tool written in PHP, Catgraph.

Projects
--------

It consists of five Maven submodules:

* vcat-core: The core library to evaluate parameters, get the necessary
  category information from the wiki and render it into an image.
* vcat-redis: An addition which allows the use of Redis (through the Jedis
  library) to store the API and metadata caches.
* vcat-webapp-base: Base classes to create Servlets which render graphs using
  vCat.
* vcat-webapp-simple: A simple Servlet version of vCat which expects
  parameters as GET or POST parameters.
* vcat-toolforge-base: Base classes for the vCat Servlet as used on Wikimedia
  Toolforge.
* vcat-toolforge-webapp: A Servlet version of vCat which uses the meta_p.wiki
  table to look up wikis, and Redis for caching, as used on Wikimedia
  Toolforge.
