vcat
====

This repository contains the Java code for the vCat 'visual' category renderer,
which uses Graphviz (http://graphviz.org/) to render the category structure of
MediaWiki wikis (in particular those run by the Wikimedia Foundation) as
graphical trees.

It replaces a similar tool written in PHP, Catgraph.

It is designed to run on the
[Toolforge](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Toolforge) environment
provided by the Wikimedia Foundation.

Maven modules
-------------

It consists of five Maven submodules:

* `vcat-core` - The core library to evaluate parameters, get the necessary
  category information from the wiki and render it into an image.
* `vcat-caffeine` - An addition which allows the use of Caffeine to store the 
  API and metadata caches.
* `vcat-toolforge-webapp`-  A version of vCat which uses the `meta_p.wiki`
  table available in the Toolforge environment to look up wikis, and Caffeine
  for caching. Builds an executable JAR file based on Quarkus
  (https://quarkus.io/). This is what runs in the Toolforge environment (also
  see the next section). 
* `vcat-webapp-simple` - A simpler version of vCat for local testing. This also
  creates am executable JAR file based on Quarkus, but does not require
  anything else.

Toolforge Build Service
-----------------------

The whole project is designed to be used with the
[Toolforge Build Service](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Toolforge/Build_Service)
to create an image which can be run in the Toolforge environment as a web
application.

In particular this includes:

* A `Procfile` to define how to start the web application
  ([see 'Procfile' in the Build Service documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Toolforge/Build_Service#Procfile)).
* `bin/vcat-toolforge-wrapper`, which is the start script referenced in
  `Procfile`.
* An `Aptfile` to define additional Ubuntu packages to be installed, which is
  used by
  [heroku-buildpack-apt](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt)
  included in the Toolforge Build Service
  ([see 'Installing Apt packages' in the Build Service documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Toolforge/Build_Service#Installing_Apt_packages)).
  In particular, this is used to install Graphviz and additional fonts.
